# Vaga Software Engineer
Descrição da vaga de Engenheiro de Software

***Why Rapidoo?***
For many small businesses, invoice factoring (desconto de duplicatas) is the only place to go when they run into financial difficulties and lose bank credit. Despite being a R$150B / year market, factoring in Brazil is broken. Because processes are antiquated and inefficient, interest rates are much higher than they should be. At Rapidoo (https://rapidoo.com.br), our mission is to fix this problem and help Brazil’s micro-entrepreneurs grow their businesses and create jobs. Using technology to automate operations and to optimize risk management, our self-service online platform offers a much better user experience and fair interest rates.

We are a well-funded, early stage fintech startup looking for an entrepreneurial software engineer to join our team as first employee. You might be our girl or guy if you are self-motivated, self-disciplined, and get excited by the idea of building something big from the ground up that will make a real difference in people’s lives. We are a diverse team with strong opinions and we care deeply about finding the right solution, not just any solution. If you do, too, we’d love to hear from you.
